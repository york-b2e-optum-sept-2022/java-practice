# this is for defining the different "containers" that your project needs to run
services:

  # this is defining the settings for the "container" named "database"
  database:
    # this is the prebuilt container "image" that we want to use
    image: "postgres:latest"

    # this maps the real computers "5432" port to the simulated computers port "5432"
    # this allows your simulated database to talk to the outside world
    ports:
      - "3000:5432"

    # tell the postgres server how to configure itself on startup
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: admin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: admin
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres

    # tells docker where to physically store the data generated by the database
    volumes:
      - ./database:/var/lib/postgresql/data
